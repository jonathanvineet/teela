# Security and Deployment Considerations

## Security
1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Store sensitive keys (e.g., WalletConnect projectId, RPC keys) in `.env` files.
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control.

2. **Smart Contracts**:
   - Audit contracts for vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, overflow).
   - Use tools like MythX, Slither, or Hardhat's security plugins.

3. **Frontend**:
   - Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
   - Use HTTPS for all API calls.

4. **Backend**:
   - Validate all incoming requests.
   - Use secure headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy).

5. **Dependencies**:
   - Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
   - Use `npm audit` and `pip-audit` to identify issues.

## Deployment
1. **Frontend**:
   - Use a CDN (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) for hosting.
   - Enable caching for static assets.

2. **Backend**:
   - Deploy using Docker containers for consistency.
   - Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) for load balancing and SSL termination.

3. **Smart Contracts**:
   - Deploy to a testnet (e.g., Sepolia) for testing before mainnet deployment.
   - Verify contracts on Etherscan.

4. **CI/CD**:
   - Automate testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.
   - Include security checks in the CI pipeline.

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Use tools like Sentry for error tracking.
   - Monitor smart contract interactions with services like Tenderly.
